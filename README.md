A Python script was created to analyze the votes in a small town that is modernizing its vote counting process. Each of the following was calculated:
1.  The total number of votes cast
2.  A complete list of candidates who received votes
3.  The percentage of votes each candidate won
4.  The total number of votes each candidate won
5.  The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
